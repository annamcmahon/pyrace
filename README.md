2 out of 2 users recommend this game! Available on localhost now!

To run the game:
One player must first run -> python gamespace.py host 'port number'.
Then the second payer must run -> python gamespace.py join 'same port number'.
Make sure both players are running gamespace.py on the same machine. We have specified the machine as 'localhost'.

To play the game:
Choose your car color. When both players respond, the game will begin.
Avoid the obstacles (!) and try to collect the coins to earn points.
Trying to go off the screen to avoid/collect anything will result in a loss of points.
Move your car with the arrow keys.
The game will go until a player gets over 200 points. The screen will be cleared and a message is displayed telling the users who won. 
TODO: Add more description

Exiting the game:
In any stage of the game the player can exit the game by clicking the exit button or the ESC key. 
If the connection was lost(if one player exits the game) both game windows will close and the game will terminate.
